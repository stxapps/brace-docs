Your data lives in a data server of your choice; only you, with your Secret Key, can change it.

Per your account, you can choose where to store your data, whether on your server or with a provider. Using your Secret Key, you can specify an alternative data server location in the Stacks blockchain. Our apps will retrieve the information when you sign in and store your data on that specified server. You truly own your data as you can access, manage, and set permissions directly on the server. Only your Secret Key can change your information in the blockchain. No one can lock you out of your own data.

##No lock out of your own data

You can manage your data and set permissions directly, as you can host your own data server or choose any data server provider.


##Data server

Brace.to stores your data in a Stacks data server. You can specify which Stacks data server to store your data in. By default, your Stacks data server is at hub.hiro.so, provided by Hiro Systems. You can also deploy your own Stacks data server. To change your Stacks data server, you must record your server's information on the Stacks blockchain. Brace.to stores your data on the server specified in the blockchain. For more details, please visit Stacks Gaia.
