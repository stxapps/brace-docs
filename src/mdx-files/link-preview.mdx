Link previews help you know whether a link is. Our app automatically creates link previews for your saved links. No personal information is involved, and you can disable this feature anytime.

A link preview, also known as a rich media preview, is a visual representation of a webpage that appears alongside a link. It provides valuable context, such as a title and thumbnail image, helping you know whether a link is. They create a more engaging and visually appealing browsing experience.

## Auto Link Preview

Our app automatically sends your saved links to our server to create link previews, extracting the titles and images from the links. We send them without any other information; no personal information is involved, and you can disable this feature at any time. It's impossible to determine who saves links. These titles and images are only used on our website and app to help you easily find and recognize your saved links.

Extracting the title and image from a link usually takes less than an hour. Links' titles and images will be shown after the extraction is complete. Sometimes, our server may retrieve incorrect link titles or images because some websites mistakenly identify us as bots or crawlers and block us, or they direct us to the wrong ones. We open-source our retrieval logic on [GitHub](https://github.com/stxapps/brace-server-worker/blob/main/src/index.js) and will continue to improve it.

## Custom Link Preview

You can also customize a link preview, changing its title and thumbnail image. On any link, please choose a three-dot button -> 'change'.
