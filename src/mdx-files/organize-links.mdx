Organize your links by moving them to Archive, Trash, or any list (folder) you create. In Settings -> Lists, you can create and organize lists (folders), such as arranging or moving into another list as needed.

## Move Links

There are two ways to move links:

1. You can move a link by clicking the link three-dot menu and choosing 'Archive', 'Remove', or 'Move to'.

2. To move multiple links simultaneously, click the 'Select' button in the top or bottom bar first. Select as many links as you want. Then, choose 'Archive', 'Remove', or 'Move to' in the top or bottom bar.

## Create a New List

Please go to Settings -> Lists to create a new list. Type a name in the text box and choose the OK (check) button. Your new list will be appended to the bottom of the others.

## Organize Lists

Also, in Settings -> Lists, you can:

- Edit a list name by clicking on the name.
- Arrange a list name with the 'up' or 'down' button.
- Move into another list with the 'Move to' button (creating nest lists or subfolders).
- Delete a list name with the 'Delete' button.

Some buttons might be in the three-dot menu. Default lists — 'My List', 'Trash', and 'Archive' — can not be deleted. 'My list' is the default list when you save a link from the browser address bar, browser extension, or mobile app. Trash is for removed links only, and you can permanently delete them here.

## Pin Links

You can choose links to always stay on the top of the list, a.k.a. Pin to the top. There are two ways to do it:

1. On any link, please choose a three-dot button -> 'Pin to the top'.
2. To pin multiple links to the top simultaneously, click the 'Select' button in the top or bottom bar first. Select as many links as you want. Then, choose 'More actions' -> 'Pin to the top' in the top or bottom bar.

To unpin links from the top, please take similar steps but choose 'Manage pin' -> 'Unpin' instead. You can also move a pinned link up or down under the 'Manage pin'.

## Tag Links

Each link can have multiple tags. Assigning a tag to a link enables you to list links with the same tag, providing an additional method to browse links, similar to lists and sublists.

There are two ways to add or manage tags:

1. On any link, please choose a three-dot button -> 'Add tags' or 'Manage tags'.
2. To add or manage tags on multiple links simultaneously, click the 'Select' button in the top or bottom bar first. Select as many links as you want. Then, choose 'More actions' -> 'Manage tags' in the top or bottom bar.

## Delete Links

Removed links in Trash will be automatically permanently deleted after 45 days. You can permanently delete any link in Trash immediately by:

1. Click the 'Permanently delete' button under the link three-dot menu.
2. To permanently delete multiple removed links, click the 'Select' button in the top or bottom bar first. Select as many removed links as you want. Then, choose the 'Permanently delete' button in the top or bottom bar.

## Delete All Data

Please go to Settings -> Data -> Delete All Data to delete all your data, including but not limited to all your saved links in all lists, all your created lists, and all your settings. This will only remove all your data, not your account. You will still be able to sign in.
